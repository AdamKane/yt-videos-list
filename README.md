## Dependencies
**NOTE**: You need to have the Selenium driver installed to run this package - the first time you run this package the automated downloader should install everything you need, but in case it doesn't, refer to the link below and/or file an [issue here](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/issues). The Selenium drivers are all pretty similar but differ in subtle ways, so play around with them and see what's different :)
