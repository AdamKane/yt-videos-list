# General Overview
This package provides a quick, simple way to create a list of all videos posted to any YouTube channel by providing just the URL to that channel's videos. Follow the link to the API in the language you want to work in from the API guides section below.

#### If you already scraped a channel and the channel uploaded a new video, simply rerun this program on that channel and this package updates your files to include the newer video(s)!

**NOTE**: You need to have the Selenium driver installed to run this package
- the first time you run this package the automated downloader should install everything you need, but in case it doesn't, refer to the link below and/or file an [issue here](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/issues).
  - Manual Selenium downloads **[here](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/blob/master/docs/dependencies_pseudo_json.txt)**
